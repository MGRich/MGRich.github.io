And we're off!
----------------
Welcome to the first ever version of PTR2Modder.
As for now, only the basic mode is implemented, but I will be working on the creating mode soon.
For now, mods can be converted by put in their ISO data with their mod folders and writing a mod.inf filel ike so:

Name of mod
Author
Version
Region

I hope this will be a helpful new strategy for modders everywhere.
