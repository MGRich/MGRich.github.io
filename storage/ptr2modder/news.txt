And we're off!
----------------
Welcome to the first ever version of PTR2Modder.
As for now, only the basic mode is implemented, but I will be working on the creating mode soon.
For now, mods can be converted by using the option in PTR2Modder and putting in their ISO data with their mod folders.

I hope this will be a helpful new strategy for modders everywhere.
