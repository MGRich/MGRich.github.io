    <p>NOTE: This is a different version of PTR2Tools which fixes a whole lot of things.
    Thanks to posesix for making these.
    Old README at the bottom.</p>

    <p>Today (2/25/18) is the day where I have fixed PTR2Tools. (Took me about 2 whole months)
    Disregard he other tutorial I made before this one, it is very outdated and will provide false information.
    This tutorial will just be an edited version of the tutorial that I had make before, although it is a bit more complex.
    It will also update every now and then, due to me making changes.</p>
    <h1 id="compilingandsetup">Compiling and setup</h1>
    <p>TO FREE MINGW:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Run "cd /".</li>
    <li>From here you can CD to the C (or any) drive by doing "cd c"</li>
    <li>You have to do this every time you start up MINGW.</li>
    <li><a href="https://msys2.org">Install MSYS2</a> and open the MINGW (this tutorial uses 64) console.</li>
    <li>Using the "TO FREE MINGW" above, direct to the directory where you want it.</li>
    <li>Using normal file explorer now, download the <code>make.sh</code> located at the releases and place it into that directory.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>3b. If you put in the file while the directory was open, do <code>cd .</code>.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Run it using <code>sh make.sh</code>.</li>
    <li>Say yes to everything, and once its finally done you should have ability to use PTR2tools (and ISOMod).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>5b. <strong>The make acts as an updater. Run it periodically to get the latest updates. Anything other than PTR2Tools will be deleted if it is placed in that folder.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>You must continue to use MINGW. The commands must be stored there. If they are not, they have the very possibility to break.</strong></p>
